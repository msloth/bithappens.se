title: Rush hour
---

Went downtown to see the city a bit more and decided to go to their equivalent of Bangkoks MBK: the Silk market building. Despite the name, there were not much silk and the harsh signs in the roof condemning piracy (sth along the lines of \"Buy original brand, do not buy fake copy!\") had little effect on the offers, customers or anything at all. Don\'t know if there were anything original there, \"original copy\" perhaps. Very pushy sellers.

Took a walk to the subway but as it was rush hour, it was so crowded so I felt that I didn\'t want to have chinese in my armpits. Back to the streets to find a taxi, no luck. Started walking, find taxi somewhere else, no luck. At rush hour, all cabs are taken.

Did some shopping but had trouble choosing.

Am I more of a grey person?

Finally I decided; these are the socks I bought. I am very happy. I think the world needs to know. I also think that they original, after all, they wouldn\'t have signs with the logos if they weren\'t, right??

When I finally got a taxi, he was one of few that would go by meter at that area. I was about to give him 20% tip (10 kr, 1â‚¬) for that (you don\'t tip in China) but he tried to make his own tip by trying to exchange my 100 to a fake one and ask me for another bill instead. The cunning nemesis of all tourist scammer that I am, I called his bluff. He abruptly lost the little english he had.
When I talked to the hotel personnel, they saw that I had a fake 50 though. Oh well, you live and learn (mostly). The things that gave it away was the texture, a bad security line and a slight color tint. Nothing you will notice unless you are used to the bills and inspect it thoroughly.
