title: Being in Beijing
---

The flight with Qatar Airways went well. Got an ok seat, but what makes them slightly better is all the complimentary stuff, like free drinks (incl whiskey :) ), and the nice entertainment system. No dancing bears, but a screen in front of you with a lot of movies to choose from. 6h to Doha, cap of Qatar, 2h wait, then 7:40h to Beijing. Took a taxi to the hotel, Park Plaza Beijing Science park, only ca 100Y (~100kr).

First night we ate at a restaurant and they were really crappy at english and had an attention span of 2sec so there were some confusion. Hot pot for all! The check was 340Y for 5 persons w dessert and beer, quite nice.

Next day, Jordi and I took a short walk and saw this pile of old airplanes and rockets that were rotting outdoors, temporarily put there while they were building a new museum.

Proof that the aliens have landed and are walking around among us.

Oh yeah, the Facebook app doesn\'t work, even though I\'m using a VPN.
