The second day, Nov 2nd, was the beginning of the event with a grand opening and unveiling of some plaquette or sth. We, Thiemo and I, didn\'t really understand everything. There were 400 Chinese and 3 Swedes. Prof Kalle from KTH were there as well and held a talk about IoT they were involved in. Everything else was in Chinese but we had headphones with real time translation by two translators. One was awesome, she kind of tried to give the meaning of what was being said instead of what the guy did. He translated every single word and it just got out of hand.

There were a lot of politicians there, and photographers and we got seats at the front with badges that said \"Delegate\" on them. Fancy! :)

Today we also met Alexa the first time. Alexa is a Chinese girl that works at the FUDAN uni (co-organizers and the ones that invited us), and who we have been emailing with regarding all kinds organisational. Also, Prof Kalles equivalent, Alex, was there. Here we also met Prof Lu from FUDAN. We all (minus PrKalle) had lunch together at a table Alexa reserved for us, marked VIP.

In the afternoon Prof Lu took us all to an old Chinese village outside Shanghai. It is now more of a tourist trap with practically nothing more than shops, vendors and small restaurants. The shops came in a few variants, eg quilt and blanket shops, handicraftshops, animal shops etc. We visited a small temple, with people trying to get money from us. Of course. They are easy to spot, wherever you are on the planet. It\'s universal.

Our hosts bought us dinner by the river; I counted to 12 different dishes, which we shared between us. Chinese style. Some were firsts for me, such as snail, crab (sorry Johan, the burnt excuse for a crab in Vietnam doesn\'t really count), lotus root w sticky rice embedded, dried small fishes (eat with head, fins and all) as well as a candidate for worst food ever: a tofu that smelled like poo. You eat it with spicy sauce. Eat da poo poo? I felt nauseus (spelling?) a whime after that. Anyway, great dinner! Fun to try new things!

Got back at around 19-20 and I got to work. I realized (and felt that) I had to redo large parts of my slides and make it better. We would be picked up by Alexa at 0730 so we would make it to 0900 (rush hour and far away). I got 1.5 hours of sleep that night, but I\'m happy I did it because it got sooo much better.

It was fun in the taxi on the way there, I felt quite \'up\' then, excited and positive. I felt I noticed small details around me, as if I was very attentive, but lacked impulse suppressive skills. Like a kid on speed. Poor Alexa had to answer many insightful and nuanced questions about electric mopeds, trees dressed with ropes etc.

The audience for our talks were around 60-70 persons, mixed about 50/50 industry/students&faculty. Great mix! I was third out and held a talk that thanks to my efforts went really well! The title was \"IoT with Contiki\" and the topic was how IoT could be realized in WSNs and the like, and how far Contiki has gotten from that perspective. (dictionary: IoT = Internet of Things, Contiki = an operating system, WSN = wireless sensor networks). People really liked when I connected to a sensor node in Zurich from my web browser (work of Matthias Kovatsch et al). I later got the feedback that I seemed energetic. Haha, yeah....well... 

We ate lunch with some faculty members and Alexa + Alex in the school dining hall, but in a separate room. Again around ten dishes, now eg pig feet, pig ear, fermented eggs. I tried them all (ok, nasty but nice to look at, really good!). No names mentioned, but someone in the room (not Chinese, not me) was joking and said that this kind of food we give to the dogs, which you (Chinese) later will take. It got quite silent in the room after that and I had to use all my dipmomatic skills to neutralize the situation. I still giggle when I think of it.

The tutorial went really well, people were interested albeit silent and not very interactive.

After everything, we were taken back for half an hour relax and shower and then Alex and Alexa took us to a restaurant for a goodbye dinner. Yet again, around ten different dishes, beer etc. Only 100rmb per person! The event paid for it. Really nice food! An observation, in China the \"little people\" are treated quite differently than in Sweden, where people are more equal. Culture shock.

Then, a short walk around the neighborhood, continuing with my many questions about Chinese culture and society. 

Lastly, collapsed in bed.

Sorry for long post, but so much happened today and I wanted to put it down here as it acts a little bit as my travel diary.

My hotel room, 19th floor, Fuxuan hotel.
