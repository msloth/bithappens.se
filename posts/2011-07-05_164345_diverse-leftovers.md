title: Diverse leftovers
---

These are some leftovers I haven\'t written about before.

There were some eerie, creepy animals in the Cambodian forest that scared the s**t out of us when we were exploring a temple that had closed for the day and was void of people. The sun had just set when these animals, called \"rajj\" started synchronizing their sound in time and frequency. Like being in a horror movie.

VID HERE, fix later.



This huge moth, big as my extended hand, sat on the bus (Siem Reap to HCMC-bus).

Really nice hotelroom. We splurged the first night but thanks to hotels.com last-minute bookings the cost was low.
