This will be the resting place for some of my work, eg published papers, systems built.

<strong>Systems, demos and tech</strong>
* *JUMP* (BSc degree project); a system to encourage children with disabilities to become more physically active; a 4 sqm dance floor with pressure sensitive cells with LEDs. I designed the hardware (functionality, IC selection, PCB design) and assembled most of the electrical HW (10k+ solder points).

* *The Lega system*; I designed the network structure and functionality for an indoor localization system and mesh network, some HW design and wrote most of the software for infrastructure nodes, mobile devices and a number of utility nodes. Implemented and evaluated the Politecast primitive for coping with massive problems with overhearing.

* *RadioSound* (part of the Inspirational Bits paper); Uses two Sky-motes, one in test mode transmitting a carrier wave and a listener measuring the RSS on that freq. Outputs a sound with pitch proportional to the RSSI; used for conveying the physical properties of 2.4 GHz. Idea and implementation by me.
