This is the resting place for some of my work, eg published papers, systems built. Incomplete, but a sample.

### Systems, demos and tech

* *JUMP* (BSc degree project); a system to encourage children with disabilities to become more physically active; a 4 sqm dance floor with pressure sensitive cells with LEDs. I designed the hardware (functionality, IC selection, PCB design) and assembled most of the electrical HW (10k+ solder points).

* *The Lega system*; I designed the network structure and functionality for an indoor localization system and mesh network, some HW design and wrote most of the software for infrastructure nodes, mobile devices and a number of utility nodes. Implemented and evaluated the Politecast primitive for coping with massive problems with overhearing.

* 
## Various small systems using motes:

*RadioSound* (Inspirational Bit); Uses two Sky-motes, one in test mode transmitting a carrier wave and a listener measuring the received signal strength (RSS) on that freq. The listener outputs a sound with a pitch proportional to the RSS; used for conveying the physical properties of 2.4 GHz. Idea and implementation by me.

*NeTopo* (Inspirational Bit); Uses &gt;=five JCreate-motes set up as a ring or star topology network. They pass a token in the network, indicated by LEDs. This bit visualizes how a data packet will travel in the two different topologies, how link failures are handled, etc. Idea and implementation by me.

*Steal the Light*; Uses two JCreate-motes, one has \'the light\' as indicated by LEDs lit, the other shall try to get close enough to \'steal\' it. The light-mote transmits periodic radio beacons (politecasts) at low transmission power setting (ie having short range) and the other listens for these beacons. If heard, a handshake and delivery occurs. Part of the evaluation of the Politecast primitive. Idea and implementation by me.
