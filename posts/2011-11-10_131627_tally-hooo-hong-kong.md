title: Tally-hooo Hong Kong!
---

I\'m in Hong Kong now :)

Some differences I noticed immediately:
* People don\'t look at me because I\'m not Chinese
* people (guys) wear shorts, that was rare in Beijing and Shenzhen
* people know english; ratio unknown, but in Shenzhen close to null, in Beijing a few more.
* MANY more foreigners! And not only westerners. Indians, pakistanis, africans (don\'t know what country, looks middle-african to me)

 Simple enough \\(•,•)/
