title: Tagged at Tianamen square

Yesterday we (Jordi and I) mostly worked on the presentation for today, but in the evening we took the subway downtown. We went to see the Forbidden city and the Himmelska fridens torg (a few call it Tianamen square though), or rather we just took the subway there and walked from there.

At the street there were many guys walking around selling their service of snapping a pic of you and printing it on a portable printer. Bo jao! One guy was soooo easy to spot secret police or sth; civilian suit but his look, posture and behavior gave him away easily.

After a while I saw this guy, and I thought to myself that this looks a bit dirty and soon enough he was following us, probably to pickpocket us (can you verbalize it like that?). I made sure we took him for a ride and ditched him in the subway (not as violent as it sounds).

On our way walking from there, we were subject to several attempts to scam us. Three times, girl(s) would come up to us and ask us if we would like to go for a few beers. Two times, we were exposed to the Art gallery scam (\"I\'m a student, come see our calligraphy art exhibit!\"). Still waiting for the tea sample scam....

Now we are waiting for the workshops to start at 9; our presentation is 1430.

Bonus: Jordi eating (I\'m a terrible friend).

Second bonus, more planes and rockets from yesterday.
