Yesterday we (Jordi and I) mostly worked on the presentation for today, but in the evening we took the subway downtown. We went to see the Forbidden city and the Himmelska fridens torg (a few call it Tianamen square though), or rather we just took the subway there and walked from there.

At the street there were many guys walking around selling their service of snapping a pic of you and printing it on a portable printer. Bo jao! One guy was soooo easy to spot secret police or sth; civilian suit but his look, posture and behavior gave him away easily.
