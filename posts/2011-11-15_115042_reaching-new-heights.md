title: Reaching New Heights
---

The last day of this visit I went to the central business district. Actually, I started at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, which has several IMAX, 3D etc cinemas to choose from. Only problem was that they are closed on Mondays, sth that no other site said sth about except their own. My bad. So I walked down Century Avenue, hoping to find a good place to buy laptop sleeves, as I had read, but that was incorrect so instead I headed towards the Jin Mao, Shanghai World Financial Center (SWFC) and the Shanghai towers.

<!--more-->









Jin Mao was built first, one of the highest skyscrapers in the world (think it had the WR for highest hotel for a while), then SWFC was built, a little bit taller, and now the Shanghai Tower is being built which will be even taller. Jin Mao has an observation deck at the 88th floor, but SWFC has one at the 100th, looking down at Jin Mao. Btw, JM is built with a mix of Chinese and modern western (I think) architecture, with a really cool exterior resembling Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur. It\'s a bit like a scaffolding-like structure on the outside so at least two persons have climbed it, the French \"Spiderman\" and a 32-year old shoe salesman who got a sudden impulse to do it :).

SWFC resembles a bottle opener, and for 150 RMB you get to visit the viewpoint at the 100th floor, being the very top of the building. There, from 474 meter, you look down on Jin Mao, and you walk across the \"bottle opener\", which even has a couple of transparent glass floor tiles so you can look down (in an angle) to the ground. Thanks to the shape, it\'s not a 360-view, but more east-west. There are also quite a bit of reflections, making it hard for photographers to snap clear shots, but I guess that problem is at every viewpoint like this. It was cool nevertheless. Went there at 16 and awaited the sunset and darkness at 17. Very cloudy and misty so rather short view :( but very cool when the city began to light up. Now I have viewpoint-pics like this from Bangkok, Cairo, Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Hanoi. Too bad I didn\'t go up Petronas :(

I finished this day with packing, but first dinner at a restaurant downtown (Nanjing E). I took, among other things, roasted pigeon. I didn\'t eat the head. But the rest was delicious!<a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-163602.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-163602.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-163602.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-163622.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-163622.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-163622.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-163729.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-163729.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-163729.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-163956.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-163956.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-163956.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164228.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164228.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-164228.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164249.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164249.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-164249.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164307.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164307.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-164307.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164324.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164324.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-164324.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164338.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164338.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-164338.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164349.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164349.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-164349.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164358.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-164358.jpg\" alt=\"20111108-164358.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a>
