So, last time I was in China (for Ubicomp), I was supposed to hold a Contiki-tutorial in Shanghai afterwards but for different reasons it was postponed, or something. The Chinese organizers never decided on a date until it was too late. Nvm.

A week after returning home they had apparently decided and I was asked if I could go back go China and take care of it. Of course I\'ll do it! :) Turns out Thiemo (my boss) couldn\'t get an Indian visa so he would join me. We were supposed to hold talks on Contiki and Internet of Things, and hold a Contiki tutorial/hands-on. This event is called \"IoT Industrial Forum 2011\" and is meant to spread knowledge and increase awareness of IoT and the possibilities it brings for smart cities. Shanghai, being a city with around 15 million population, is very interested in this.

So, a couple of days ago (the 31st of October), I suited up, took my luggage and locked my door behind me. The flight went very well and I felt very important (even more that is) when I worked on my computer in-flight. During the trip I finished the slides for the hands-on; the slides and talk for the morning was to a large extent done but needed some polishing, filling and rehearsing.

Landed at 14 the 1st Nov, at Hongqia airport and took a taxi to the hotel, which was booked and paid for by the event organizers. I was so tired that I blacked out -not fell asleep!- a few times during the 1hour and 100RMB drive (as before, 1rmb-= 1 sek).

My \"just gonna power nap a quickie\" turned into a 2 hour snooze-hitting balooza, and I missed out on Thiemos stroll downtown. Instead, I went out for sth to eat at 20 with the ambition to work when I got back. No dice grandpa.
