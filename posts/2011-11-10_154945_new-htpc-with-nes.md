title: New HTPC with NES
---

So Roger (a friend of mine) and I each bought ourselves a new HTPC. It is based on an Asus AT3IonT-I deluxe Mini-ITX motherboard in a NES chassis. The mobo has hardware accelerated decoding of HD material, built in WiFi, Bluetooth, comes with an IR remote, is fanless and uses a power brick instead of an ATX PSU. This last point (and HW decoding of course) is key. This way, the mobo can be fitted in a very small case, the Nintendo 8-bit NES being of ideal size, fitting the mobo, a 2.5\" HD, a fan etc.

My goal is to have a small, (completely) silent HTPC that I can watch HD movies and play emulators on. This mobo uses a power brick instead of a normal PSU so power for HDs etc is routed through the mobo via a molex connector to max 3 SATA devices. For both me and Roger, the included cable was assembled wrongly; +5V and +12V had switched places so we fried a HD before we saw the error. I am currently in the process of getting the HD reimbursed; I soldered a new cable which works great.

So this was the plan:
* adapt the NES chassis with a Dremel so that the mobo et al fits
* install XBMC
* stream movies via SMB from a NAS
