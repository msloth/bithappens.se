title: Linux signals
---

Signals are software interrupts to processes (in POSIX-compliant systems).
<strong>SIGSTOP</strong> <strong>(19)</strong> stops the process, halts all execution but does not kill it. It <strong>cannot</strong> be trapped/ignored.
<strong>SIGCONT</strong> <strong>(18)</strong> continues a process stopped with SIGSTOP.
<strong>SIGINT</strong> <strong>(2)</strong> sends an interrupt to the process, which decides what to do with it. It <strong>can</strong> be trapped/ignored. Usually sent with ctrl+C.
<strong>SIGTERM</strong> <strong>(15)</strong> sends an irq to kill the process. This is a graceful way to kill it and lets it do what it needs before shutting down (eg saving data).
<strong>SIGKILL</strong> <strong>(9)</strong> ungracefully kills the process. It <strong>cannot</strong> be trapped/ignored.

The signals can be sent by eg
`
kill -15 2342
`
15 being the signal number, 2342 being the process ID (PID, from running a ps command).

I found <a href=\"http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6483\">this link to be very informative and educating.
