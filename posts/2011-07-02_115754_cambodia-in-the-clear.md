title: Cambodia in the clear

So, we have now left Cambodia behind us. We visited some more temples, but left many behind. There are simply too many! Bantey Srey is an area which is supposed to be good, but 37 km from Siem Reap so we didn\'t have time for it.

Siem Reap is a small town, ca 10.000 inhabitants, but it has a club I feel Stockholm is lacking. We joined some locals for some interesting dishes, and I quote, \"Egg has baby\". Then we rent a small VIP room at a place where they had karaoke, two girls sat in the room with the sole task of entering the song numbers into the machine. Wicked. Great fun and we finished the night in a local club and had fun as hell, dancing our asses off to great music, friendly people and a great atmosphere. Might be because we were the only falang there, but it doesn\'t matter :)

Flights to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam are about 170 USD so we took a night bus for 20 instead. We got ripped of though because it wasn\'t the kind of bus he showed us (higher comfort, and that matters when the trip is 12+ hours). We finished off Siem Reap with some amazingly good food.
