title: Surreal in Saigon

The night before we left Saigon/HCMC we decided to head on out, making the city the most insecure since the \'70-ies. Turns out Saigon had a few surprises itself. 

According to Google searches, the best clubs would be Gossip club, Apocalypse Now, Lush, and Velvet. We decided to start at the supposed THE place to go to. No entrance fee, nice! Thank you pale falang-skin and shining smile ;)
