Chatuchak market was as cramped and chaotic as I remembered, so many booths and people in narrow lanes. The roof made it a very warm and humid experience, although we didn\'t buy anything there were plenty of maybes. Then we roamed the Siam malls and I bought nice goggles for a really nice price (900B ~= 180kr). Looking forward to using them!

We changed hotel from Davis Bkk hotel at Sukhumvit (awesome!!) to Prince Palace hotel in old town (?). Even though the price was very nice (27€ for Executive suite, corner room at 20th floor in a 68m2 room), it had seen its better days. Hotels.com rocks for findng good hotels at good prices but we found that the official hotels.com app for Iphone consistently has higher prices. We compared with the site on a laptop, eg 22€ was 27€ in the app (all else being the same). That\'s not nice.

Now we\'re sitting on the bus from Bkk (from Mo chit station, 220B/person to Aranyaprathep, then tuktuk, then cross border, then taxi) to Siem Reap. It\'s a bit cramped and warm but not badly, we\'ll survive :). It\'s supposed to take 4h to A so now 20 min left. I hope the crossing will go smooth, I have read that there is a lot of corruption at this place.
