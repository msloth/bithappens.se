title: Linux signals

Signals are software interrupts to processes (in POSIX-compliant systems).
*SIGSTOP* *(19)* stops the process, halts all execution but does not kill it. It *cannot* be trapped/ignored.
*SIGCONT* *(18)* continues a process stopped with SIGSTOP.
*SIGINT* *(2)* sends an interrupt to the process, which decides what to do with it. It *can* be trapped/ignored. Usually sent with ctrl+C.
*SIGTERM* *(15)* sends an irq to kill the process. This is a graceful way to kill it and lets it do what it needs before shutting down (eg saving data).
*SIGKILL* *(9)* ungracefully kills the process. It *cannot* be trapped/ignored.

The signals can be sent by eg
`
kill -15 2342
`
15 being the signal number, 2342 being the process ID (PID, from running a ps command).
