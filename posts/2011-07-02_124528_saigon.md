We arrived in a intermittently very rainy Saigon. Or Ho Chi Minh City/HCMC as it is called now after the latest war but many still call it Saigon.

Traffic in the rain:

We got a really nice hotel room but stayed only one night before we moved on to next one. Might have said it before but the hotels.com app is more expensive than going through the site directly.

Saigon is full of stores selling replicas/copies at dirtcheap prices. A watch varies between 15-65$ depending on quality etc.

Other things include the usual touristy stuff: bags, tshirts, tailors etc. Thankfully, they are not pushy. A simple \"khong cam on\" is enough. Overall, the quality, prices and product offerings easily beats (but somewhat complements) Thailand.

Pho is noodle soup with eg beef in it. Pho24 is a nice chain for really nice pho and fruit drinks. Costs about 100.000 Dong ~ 30 kr. <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/20110702-071625.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.bithappens.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/20110702-071625.jpg\" alt=\"20110702-071625.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a>

We also had some Vietnamese coffee, which is like really strong espresso saturated with sugar. Tasty!
