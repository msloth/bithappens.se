title: Surreal in Saigon
---

The night before we left Saigon/HCMC we decided to head on out, making the city the most insecure since the \'70-ies. Turns out Saigon had a few surprises itself. 

According to Google searches, the best clubs would be Gossip club, Apocalypse Now, Lush, and Velvet. We decided to start at the supposed THE place to go to: Gossip.

No entrance fee, nice! Thank you pale falang-skin and shining smile ;) The music was reeeeeally heavy, the volume was insane and there was a crowd dancing on a small dance floor podium in the center. The place looked really nice and a little posh. The amount of security was insane. 10-15 security guys with SECURITY written on their backs were walking around, eyeing people. And this is a really small place!

Went to the bar and ordered drinks two times (very weak, not according to Swedish standards) and the second time we realized they didn\'t give back the change (300 of 500kD bills both times). We asked them about it and they gave back 300, we asked again and they came with 200 more. Still 100 missing, oh well, screw it. Went to the other bar the next time and they salted the bill from 185 to 220 kD. Screw it.

After having danced around for a while we left with our ears ringing. Took a cab to the only place we remembered was close to our hotel (leaving next day) was Apoc now. When there we see a lot of pros, and I\'m not speaking of the bartenders. Look in a random direction and you\'ll def have someone trying to catch your eyesight. Found a bunch of fun Irish and had great fun till they closed.
