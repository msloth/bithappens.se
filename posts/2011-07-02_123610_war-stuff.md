We went to see the War remnants museum, which is a museum for the Vietnam/American war. There were some fighter jets, tanks, old bombs and equipment and guns on display but most moving was the very many photos and stories from both V\'s and A\'s.

Saw a woman/girl that took photos of many of the nasty pics of mutilated bodies etc. Interesting. She seemed focused on those.

There were also devices from one of the worlds first wireless sensor network deployments on display, the ADSID.

And if this is what you see, it will soon be your last glimpses :o

Of course we had to try some candy, both local and imported stuff :)

Today we went to the Cu Chi-tunnels, a 200 km network of tunnels where the Viet-Cong hid and used for underground transports during the war. We got to walk in a falang-sized tunnel which was hard enough but also tried going down a hatch in an originalsized. The opening was 30*30cm. I got stuck. :S It could have been touristy but it wasn\'t that bad, we really enjoyed it. We got to try boiled tapioca-root which tasted like potato but less soft, more fibers. Very naaaajj!

Tomorrow evening we are flying to Da Nang (350kr) then taxi 30 min to Hoi An for an amazing beach and nice tailors. Last time I was there I got stuff of so-so quality. Now I know where to go.
