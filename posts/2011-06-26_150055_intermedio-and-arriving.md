title: Intermedio and arriving
---

We had almost five hours transfertime at Charles de Gaulles, Paris,before the flight to Bangkok so we took a quick detour to have some red wine at a small café close to Notre Dame. From CDG it was a 45 min at 8.5€ trainride. Never been to Paris before, and it was very nice! I will come back here some other time :).

We flew with Air France and I must say I\'m impressed! Quite spacious seats, nice food, got a gift bag w ear plugs and stuff. 

Landed after an 11 hour flight so we were quite exhausted after ca 22 hours travels so we took a cab to the Davis BKK hotel and relaxed for a while. Then we went out for some random strolling around in a cloudy but hot and moisty Thailand. Seems like the traffic situation is better than last time, four years ago, now less honking and clogging. Also tried a mopedtaxiride, that was a very liberating feeling sitting there, seeing the lights flicker by while the driver zigzags between cars. 

One more day, then we\'re off to Cambodia and Siem Reap! We\'ll spend it at Chatuchak market, among other things.
