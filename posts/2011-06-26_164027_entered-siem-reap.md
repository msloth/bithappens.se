title: Entered Siem Reap
---

Yes, I heard right, there def is corruption. After shooing away the expected touts, first thing that happens is that a welldecorated police officer sees my shopping bag of food and \"asks\" me to give something because he\'s hungry. In front of other cops and tourists, without shame. I find it a little funny and gives him a bun (fika ftw!). Next thing, they ask for 25$ instead of 20$. Wasn\'t a problem though, I just said clearly and with my thunderous authority that it\'s only 20. Then a quite long and sleepy taxiride to Siem Reap, which is the town just south of the temples, whereof Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm (from Tomb Raider) are the most known. 

It now 2330 and we recently finished some room service late dinner at the room. Delicious and inexpensive! Also had the luck of running into a Tuk-tuk driver that seems nice, ok price (15$ early days, 13$ otherwise), can & will drive us and doesn\'t speak Swedish! (the first did, and we don\'t want that).

Siem Reap has a lot of similarities with Sharm el Sheik/Egypt. Similar spacing between buildings, streets etc. Pretty clean, mostly. Many new buildings due to economic boom but still very many poor people around. Some street kids. 

Tomorrow we\'ll meet the Tuktukdriver at 0440 for a sunriseview of Angkor wat and then on to Ta Prohm. Rise and shine! :)

Delicious sandwich ;)

Nice hotelroom, almost lives up to my standards ;) Cost, 35â‚¬ for both, one night. In Cambodia, USD is used the most and Cambodian Riel only as change to max 1 $.
